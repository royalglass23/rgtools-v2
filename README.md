# rgtools

Internal operations toolkit for Royal Glass, covering lead intake and scoring, client records, quote pipeline tracking, quote engagement analytics, Producer Statement generation, and operational admin workflows.

## Workspace layout

This repo is a pnpm workspace:

- `apps/web` - the internal RG Tools Next.js app.
- `apps/catalog` - placeholder public catalog app for `catalog.royalglass.co.nz`.
- `packages/db` - shared Drizzle schema and database client.
- `workers/*` - Cloudflare Workers deployed separately from the apps.

## What it does

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | KPI overview for active tracked quotes, plus configurable operational tables |
| **Lead Intake** | Staff form to capture and score inbound enquiries, auto-syncs to ServiceM8 |
| **Leads** | Paginated lead list and detail view with tier, ServiceM8, table, and date filters |
| **Clients** | Canonical client records, linked lead/job context, and merge review tooling |
| **Quote Tracker** | Pull a ServiceM8 quote into a tracked short link, share it, inspect client engagement, and generate AI follow-up guidance |
| **Work Orders** | Staff summary for active installation work orders from ServiceM8, including operational fields and portal-safe timeline candidates |
| **PS Generator** | Generate PS1 and PS3 Producer Statement PDF packages from published system, option, template, mapping, and wording configuration |
| **Admin** | User/module access, scoring/pricing/tracking settings, lead import, dashboard tables, audit/error exports, and client merge review |

## Security

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for reporting and operational security expectations. The short version: do not commit secrets, keep local and preview environments off production data unless explicitly performing a production operation, and use the documented module-access and audit boundaries for staff-facing changes.

## Changelog

See [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

## Quick start (dev)

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in values - see docs/dev/setup.md
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm seed                    # creates initial admin user and module rows
pnpm seed:ps-generator       # seeds published PS Generator config
pnpm seed:tracking           # seeds quote tracking settings
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For a one-off production migration without changing `.env.local`, set `DB_URL_PROD`
to the production Neon pooled URL and run:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate:prod
```

## Quote pipeline scripts

```bash
pnpm quote:pull --latest        # pull metadata + PDF from ServiceM8 to tmp/
pnpm quote:preview --latest     # local viewer in browser
pnpm quote:share --latest       # public Cloudflare tunnel link
pnpm quote:create --job R260210 # create a tracked quote in the DB
pnpm quotes:client-backfill     # link historical quotes to client records
pnpm clients:merge-cleanup      # apply reviewed client merge cleanup
```

## Tests

```bash
pnpm test             # workspace tests, then web app test run
pnpm test:run         # alias for the full test command
pnpm test:workspace   # root workspace guardrail tests only
pnpm test:integration # live DB integration tests
pnpm test:e2e         # Playwright e2e tests
```
