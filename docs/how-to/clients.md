# Client Records

The Clients area shows the canonical RG Tools client records that connect lead intake, quote tracking, and ServiceM8 job context.

## Who can use it

- Staff need access to the `clients` module.
- Admins can also use client merge review under **Admin -> Client Merge Review**.

## Client list

Open **Clients** from the navigation bar. The list is for finding the customer record before jumping into related work.

Use it to check:

- Client or company name.
- Aliases or alternate names from imports and merges.
- Phone and email details.
- Linked leads.
- Linked tracked quotes.
- ServiceM8 job context where available.

Use **Search** to find a client by canonical name or alias. Use **Cleanup filter** after a ServiceM8 import to narrow the list to imported clients, clients that need review, reviewed clients, possible duplicates, clients with no contact details, clients with no client type, or ServiceM8-linked clients.

Client matching is based on normalised phone and email values. When a new lead or tracked quote arrives, rgtools tries to connect it to the existing client record rather than creating a duplicate.

## Client detail

Open a client row to see the detail page at `/clients/[id]`.

The detail page is the best place to answer:

- Which leads came from this client?
- Which quote links have been sent to this client?
- What job or ServiceM8 context is already connected?
- Are there duplicate records that an admin should review?

Use the linked lead and quote rows to move into the workflow that needs action.

Admins can use **Client cleanup** on the detail page to edit the canonical client name, type/classification, primary contact, manual aliases, review status, review note, and shared client notes. Source aliases from imports and merges are preserved separately so cleanup does not overwrite the raw ServiceM8 context.

## Duplicate clients

Duplicate client records can happen when contact details are missing, typed differently, or imported from older jobs.

Admins review suspected duplicates from **Admin -> Client Merge Review**. Merge cleanup is intentionally admin-controlled because client records connect multiple workflows.

Strong ServiceM8 identity matches can be planned for safe auto-merge. Ambiguous matches stay in the review queue, where admins can either choose the survivor client or dismiss a false match. Merged duplicates are hidden from normal client lists but kept as merged references so old imports and links can still resolve to the survivor.

## Admin operation notes

Run **Refresh from ServiceM8** from the Clients list when you want to import or refresh company/client records. A successful run reports scanned, created, updated, needs-review, skipped, and error counts. If row-level errors occur, the import can still complete and the warning is written to the admin error log with the import summary.

After a large import, check **Cleanup filter -> Needs Review**, **No Contact Details**, **No Client Type**, and **Possible Duplicates**. Keep cleanup in small batches and use the client detail page for canonical edits. Dashboard edits, duplicate merges, and duplicate dismissals are admin-only and write audit or error-log entries.

If a merge was wrong, v1 has no one-click undo. Correct it manually by creating or editing the correct survivor client, moving affected leads/quotes/work orders/contacts back to the right client in the database, and leaving an audit note explaining the correction. Use the hidden merged reference and aliases to identify what was absorbed.
