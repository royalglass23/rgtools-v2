# Lead Intake Form

The lead intake form is at `/lead-intake`. Use it to record new enquiries from phone, email, WeChat, calculator, contact forms, or other channels.

## Opening the Form

Click **Lead Intake** in the navigation. If you do not see it, ask an admin to grant module access.

## Score Panel

The score panel updates live as you fill in the Decision Matrix fields. It shows:

- Tier A-E
- Current score and completeness
- Last update and follow-up date

The follow-up date is prefilled from the tier cadence until you type your own date.

## Required Fields

The minimum save is:

- Client Name / Business Name
- Phone
- Email
- Job Address

If a client with the same phone number or email already exists, their record is reused and updated.

## First-Call Fields

Use **Product** for the actual glass product, such as pool fence, balustrade, shower, handrail, or other.

Use **Job Description** for a short project summary from the call.

Use **Channel** for how the enquiry arrived, such as phone, email, WeChat, calculator, contact form, or other.

## Decision Matrix Fields

The score comes from the hardcoded Decision Matrix:

- Client Type
- Budget Band
- Resource Consent
- Building Consent
- Building Stage
- Project Type
- Price-sensitivity Read
- Decision-makers
- Distance
- Source
- Payment History
- Site Access
- Installation Height

Distance is computed from the job address. Do not guess answers for fields the customer has not provided.

## Saving a Lead

Click **Save and score**. The form validates the required fields, saves the client and lead, computes the score/tier/completeness, audit-logs the change, and attempts to sync the lead to ServiceM8.

## Editing a Lead

Open a lead from `/leads` and click **Edit**. A reason for edit is required before saving changes; this reason is recorded in the audit log.
